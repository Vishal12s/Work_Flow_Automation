Automation of Flowcharts: Installation Guide
To guarantee a smooth implementation process, I am providing you with a comprehensive
guide detailing the necessary dependencies and essential setup steps. Please refer to the
following instructions to ensure the successful execution of the code.

Prerequisites:

1. Install the &quot;graphviz&quot; Package:
- To initiate the installation, execute the command: `pip install graphviz`
- This package is pivotal for rendering the flowcharts effectively.

2. Installing the Graphviz Module:
- It is crucial to note that the &quot;graphviz&quot; package is not inherently part of basic Python files.
Thus, it must be installed as an additional module. Follow these steps:

- Download the Graphviz Installer:
Visit the official Graphviz website at https://graphviz.org/download/ and choose the
appropriate installer based on your operating system.

- Follow Installation Instructions:
Execute the installer and adhere to the platform-specific installation instructions. This will
ensure the proper integration of Graphviz with your system.

3. Adding Graphviz to PATH (For Windows Users):
- For Windows users, the inclusion of the Graphviz bin directory in the system&#39;s PATH is
crucial for seamless operation. Here&#39;s how to do it:

- Accessing Environment Variables:
- Utilize the Windows search bar to find &quot;Environment Variables.&quot;
- Click on &quot;Edit the system environment variables.&quot;

- Modifying System Variables:
- In the System Properties window, click on the &quot;Environment Variables&quot; button.
- Under &quot;System Variables,&quot; locate and select the &quot;Path&quot; variable, then click &quot;Edit.&quot;
